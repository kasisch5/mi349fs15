This website is going to display all of my YouTube videos, so that in the future, 
viewers can simply visit my personal webpage in addition to watching them on YouTube.

OrbitGuy, is the name for my YouTube channel where I post various gaming related videos.
  I purchased the domain name for this website and am turning it into a large collection 
  of my work, both the good and the videos that did not make the cut.  I have been producing
  videos since the winter of 2014, and orbitguy.com will display some of my most recent videos 
  as well as some unseen content from the very start.  The website will also include some other 
  personal projects that I think people would enjoy, such as some indie games I have worked on in
  my spare time.
